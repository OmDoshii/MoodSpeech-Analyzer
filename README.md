SpeechMood Analyzer is an interactive real-time application that leverages machine learning to recognize emotions from spoken language. The application uses speech recognition and emotion analysis models to process audio input from a microphone, transcribe it into text, and determine the predominant emotion conveyed. SpeechMood Analyzer can recognize various emotions, including anger, joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, and neutrality. This project demonstrates the integration of speech recognition and natural language processing for emotion analysis, which can benefit various applications, including customer service, mental health monitoring, and user experience enhancement.
